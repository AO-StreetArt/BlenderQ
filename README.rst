BlenderQ
========

Overview
--------

BlenderQ is a super-simple Python program that provides a UI for rendering multiple
Blender files, one after another.  It is absolutely barebones, so don't expect
any bells and whistles.  Just queue up Blender Renders and go get a beer.

We rely on Tkinter for the User Interface, so ensure you have it installed:

`sudo apt-get install python python-tk`

or

`sudo yum install python python-tk`

Then, we can run the program with

`python blenderq.py`

Platform Support
----------------

BlenderQ is currently only compatible with Python2.7 on Linux platforms.
