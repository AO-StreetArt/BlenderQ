BlenderQ
========

Overview
--------

BlenderQ is a super-simple Python program that provides a UI for rendering multiple
Blender files, one after another.  It is absolutely barebones, so don't expect
any bells and whistles.  Just queue up Blender Renders and go get a beer.

Oh, Did we mention that it's free?

Platform Support
----------------

BlenderQ is tested on Ubuntu 16.04, but the implementation should be compatible with
any OS compatible with Blender.
