We love pull requests from everyone.  If you'd like to participate, please follow the basic outline below:

Start by forking the repository and cloning your repository.

Make your changes, push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Comment your code
* Write a good commit message
* Test your code before you submit a PR
